# Setting Up an Amazon S3 Bucket

This guide will walk you through the steps to create and configure an Amazon S3 bucket for your project.

## Step 1: Create an AWS Account

1. Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. Click on "Create an AWS Account" and follow the instructions to set up your account.

## Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket

1. Open the S3 console at https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
2. Click "Create bucket".
3. Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `cogify`), choose a region, and click "Create bucket".

## Step 3: Configure Public Access

1. Go to the "Permissions" tab of your bucket.
2. In the "Block public access" section, uncheck the "Block all public access" option.
3. Confirm the changes to allow public access.

## Step 4: Update Bucket Policy

1. Go to the "Permissions" tab and find the "Bucket policy" section.
2. Click "Edit" and paste the following JSON policy:
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cogify/*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
3. Save the policy.

## Step 5: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

1. In the "Permissions" tab, find the "CORS configuration" section.
2. Click "Edit" and add the following configuration:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "*"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "PUT",
                "POST",
                "DELETE",
                "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
    ```
3. Save the CORS configuration.

## Step 6: Set Up IAM User and Permissions

1. Go to the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. Click "Users" and then "Add user".
3. Enter a username (e.g., `s3admin`), select "Programmatic access", and click "Next".
4. Attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy to the user.
5. Complete the creation process to generate an `Access key ID` and `Secret access key`.

## Step 7: Configure Environment Variables

1. Save the `Access key ID` and `Secret access key` as environment variables in your `.env` file:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with your actual keys.

That's it! Your S3 bucket is now set up and configured for public access, with the necessary IAM permissions and environment variables ready for your application.
